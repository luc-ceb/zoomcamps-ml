### Notes
This project is about the creation of a model for helping users to predict car prices. The dataset was obtained from [this kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/CooperUnion/cardataset).
Project plan:
* Prepare data and Exploratory data analysis (EDA).
* Use linear regression for predicting price.
* Undetstanding the internals of linear regression.
* Evaluating the model with RMSE.
* Feature engineering.
* Regularization.
* Using the model.
