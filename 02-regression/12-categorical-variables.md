### Notes
Categorical variables are typically strings, and pandas identify them as object types. These variables need to be converted to a numerical form because the ML models can interpret only numerical features. It is possible to incorporate certain categories from a feature, not necessarily all of them. This transformation from categorical to numerical variables is known as One-Hot encoding.
